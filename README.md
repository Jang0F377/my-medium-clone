# Medium clone build - Typescript
This is a Typescript clone build of the blog publishing platform, Medium, website.
 * Full-Stack, Next.JS with Sanity backend.
 * SSR & SSG & Next.JS API routes
 * Fully mobile responsive

# Technologies used:
 * typescript
 * Next.JS 
 * Sanity Studio
 * Tailwind CSS (Tailwind all the way!!)
 * react hook form
 * react portable text & next sanity

# What have I learned thus far:
 * First Next.JS & typescript project -
   * SSR & SSG (Home page is served SSR while specific Post page is served SSG)
   * How to implement dynamic page routes.
   * How to use the API routes that come in Next.
 * How to implement a Sanity Studio backend 
   * Write & Query data
   * Create Schemas that reference other Schemas
 * First time using React Hook Form
   * Really cool library to handle form input - https://react-hook-form.com/

# Hurdles Overcome
 * Understanding how to implement the API routes in Next
 * Implementing SSR & SSG also dynamic page routes.
 * Programmatically connecting and querying/writing data.

# Still to do:
 * Implement ability to add posts.
